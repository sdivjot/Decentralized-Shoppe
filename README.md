# Decentralized Shoppe: A Decentralized Shopping Application based on Amazon

A blockchain project that emulates Amazon shopping in a Decentralized fashion using ReactJS + Solidity-Hardhat

***
## *Blockchain*

**Solidity:** Uses Solidity to write smart contracts that manage item listing, sale, user data storage on-chain.

**IPFS:** Used to store media in a decentralized way such as product images to reduce blockchain cost.

**Hardhat:** Framework used for building, testing and deploying smart contracts on local blockchain node.

**Mocha and Chai:** Used for smart contract testing and task verification.

***
## *Client-Side Interface*

**ReactJS:** Utilized for building a dynamic user interface, ensuring a smooth shopping experience, along with effective communication to the Metamask Chrome Extension.

**Ethers.js:** Web3 library used to communicate with the deployed smart contract and call its various functions to accomplish tasks such as listing and buying items.
